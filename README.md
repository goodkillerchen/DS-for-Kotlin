# DS-for-Kotlin
Just write some classic data structure by kotlin during my leisure.
Now, it has the data structure as below:
1. Linkedlist
2. BST(binary search tree)
3. Map(red-black tree)

The following data structure will be updated like:
1. Unordered-map(hash table)
2. KMP
3. trie tree
4. regular expression
5. some algorithm about string
6. some algorithm about graph
7. ...

The project will be continue updated
