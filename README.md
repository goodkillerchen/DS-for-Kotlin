# DS-for-Kotlin
Just write some classic data structure by kotlin during my leisure.
Now, it has the data structure as below:
1. Linked-list
2. BST(binary search tree)
3. Map(red-black tree)
4. Unordered-map(hash table)

The following data structure will be updated like:
1. <del>Unordered-map(hash table)
2. KMP
3. trie tree
4. regular expression
5. some other algorithms about string
6. topological sort
7. directed cycle find
8. Two algorithms for scc(Tarjan and Kosaraju-Sharir)
9. ...

The project will be continue updated
